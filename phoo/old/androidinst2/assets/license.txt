Please read this agreement before continuing. 

CDC32 and CDC-X are Copyright 1995-2017 (c) Dwyco, Inc., All rights reserved.

This distribution of CDC-X is Freeware.

You are welcome to use it for as long as you like. There is no
expiration on the software. If your usage of the system is
consistent with typical usage patterns of users that employ
the software as a chat site, you will probably never be asked to pay
for the Dwyco service. If you use the system as something other
than a "chat" site, you may be asked to pay for a subscription
to the Dwyco service.

In addition, there may be several "Advanced features" in any
given version of CDC-X that are enabled during a trial period (usually
several weeks). You must buy a subscription to use them after the
trial period. Currently, there are no "pay features", all features
are available to all users for free.

After the trial period, CDC-X remains completely functional except for
these features.

Note: for the Linux version of the software, the advanced features
are provided for free. However, we encourage Linux users to buy
subscriptions to help support further development of CDC-X for Linux.

Instructions for buying a subscription to the Dwyco service are 
available by clicking Help|How to buy a subscription...
or clicking on the credit-card button on the toolbar after starting the program.

You MAY make copies of the program for your personal or
friends' use, upload it to Web sites, post it to newsgroups, or
distribute it through other channels as long as no direct fee is charged
for the software. No part of this license shall imply that
copies of CDC-X can be redistributed or remarketed with other products
without the prior written consent of Dwyco, Inc.
