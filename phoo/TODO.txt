* reinstate optimizations in msglistmodel.cpp
* possible re-port over to rando before we integrate into master
* android: need to fix background message checking to use new api

* eventually, for video stuff:
 * everywhere there is a video option, make sure you can control the camera from there.
 * try to detect when the camera is supplying no frames, and eliminate those options.
 * get rid of frame sizes, just pick one. allow frame sizes for advanced menu or something.
 * reinstate some kind of conferencing thing.
 * think about some kind of "chat+pic send" thing as we had before
