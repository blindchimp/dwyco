The splayer example is a experimental simple Theora player using SDL and 
Portaudio for cross platform compatibility. To build the windows version 
please use the Visual C++ project available at the 
win32/experimental/splayer directory.

By default this sample  will not be built on Linux, unless Portaudio is 
properly installed. Follow these steps to install Portaudio:

1) Get portaudio tar package from www.portaudio.com
2) Uncompress it to a local directory
3) Run './configure' in the portaudio directory
4) Run 'make install'

This will install Portaudio libraries in /usr/local/lib, and the Portaudio 
include file at /usr/local/include. On linux you may need to manually 
execute 'ldconfig' to rebuild the library cache.

Switch to theora's directory, re-run theora's autogen.sh script to 
re-generate the appropriate makefiles, and 'make install' to build.
