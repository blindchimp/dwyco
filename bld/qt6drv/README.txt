This is a small set of drivers for the dwyco core which use
Qt 5 multimedia for doing video capture, audio capture and audio playback.
This is a replacement for the old drivers, which worked fine up to
Mojave on the Mac, but under Catalina, they no longer work (never mind
the fact that I had to use a really old version of xcode to compile them.)

Anyways, these aren't as well tested as the old drivers, but at least
it is a way forward that doesn't involve doing native drivers for
the Mac.
