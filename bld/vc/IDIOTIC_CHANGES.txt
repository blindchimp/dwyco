There are two idiotic changes you have to make directly to the
include files of any windows-based SDK (from borland or ms).

in objbase.h, find DBG and change it to WINDBG. this is just a conflict
in the naming of the define.
in winsock.h, find the non-WSA errors and change the "#if 0" to "#if 1".
this is just a portability thing because i can't be bothered to
change all my error code stuff to the WSA stuff (won't work on unix stuff.)
