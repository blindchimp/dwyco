.SH NAME
spread \- Multicast Group Communication Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "spread [-l " y/n "] [-n " proc_name "] [-c " config_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B spread
runs the Spread daemon on the local machine using the
default configuration file spread.conf unless told 
otherwise. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-l y/n"
Turn on or off logging. Default is off.
.IP "-n proc_name"
Force this daemon to be identified by a specific process name.
.IP "-c config-file"
Use an alternate configuration file
.I config-file
instead of
.IR ./spread.conf .
.SH FILES
.I ./spread.conf
.RS
The default config file location. 
.I /etc/spread.conf 
is also searched if a local file is not found.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The daemon will output some startup information to stdout
and any severe errors will also be output to stdout. Redirecting
standard out to a file or using the EventLogFile directive in the spread.conf 
file is recommended if you are interested in log messages.
.SH BUGS
None currently known. The libspread library is thread-safe. However, 
the libspread-core.a library is not thread-safe. The libtspread-core.a 
library is the version to use if you need a thread-safe version of the core. 
The non-thread-safe library is
provided for those who are writing single-threaded applications and do not
want to pay the minimal performance penalty for locking.
