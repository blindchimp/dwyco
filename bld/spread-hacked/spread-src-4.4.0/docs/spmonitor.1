.SH NAME
spmonitor \- Spread Monitoring and Adminstration client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "spmonitor [-n " proc_name "] [-c " config_file "] [-t " status_timeout "] [-p " port "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B spmonitor
Provides a general monitoring and administrative tool for the Spread system. 
The spmonitor program can send queries and commands to Spread daemons to either
gather debugging or performance statistics, or to shut down specific daemons or
change flow control parameters of the system to tune performance. 

Some details about the effective use of the spmonitor program are contained
in the Users Guide which is available from the Spread web site www.spread.org.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-t status_timeout"
The seconds between every status report. The default is 10.
.IP "-p port"
The port number, to which the spmonitor 
program should connect in order to reach a Spread daemon.
.IP "-n proc_name"
Force this daemon to be identified by a specific process name.
.IP "-c config-file"
Use an alternate configuration file
.I config-file
instead of
.IR ./spread.conf .
.SH FILES
.I ./spread.conf
.RS
The default config file location. 
.I /etc/spread.conf 
is also searched if a local file is not found.
.SH BUGS
The spmonitor works by sending UDP packets to the Spread daemon, so if network 
losses occur, commands or status reports can be lost. It can also lose reports
when monitoring a large number of daemons.
