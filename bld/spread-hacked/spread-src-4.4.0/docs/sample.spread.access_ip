# This is the configuration file for IP restricted access to a Spread daemon.
# Each line represents an allowed IP address or network address
# The keywords "unix" and "local" can be used to allow connections from
# Unix Domain Sockets and localhost TCP connections respectively.
# 
# So a sample file which only allowed local connections would be as shown
# below (but with the comment '#' characters removed.
#
#unix
#local 
#
# A file allowing access from local clients and clients on a 
# private network with addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 would be:
#
#unix
#local
#192.168.1.0/24
#
#
# This format follows standard network address formatting where the 
# IPv4 network address is followed by a '/' and the number of bits which
# make up the network portion of the IP address. A '/24' corresponds
# with what used to be called a "Class C" address and a '/16' with a "Class B".
