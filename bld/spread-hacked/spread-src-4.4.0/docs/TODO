Features, ideas, and other things that might get done.
Those ending with (*break) break binary,source or client-server compatability
------------------------------------------------------
* Improve stability under high load

* Change max buffered message limit to be not just num messages, but also size, or other parameters.
* Make this runtime configurable.

* Fix partial DOS when someone connects and doesn't send anything (the 1 second delay)
* Merge cleanup of session layer from research branch

* Once ses ids are non-volatile (fix for session_index on windows) have group 
  struct store ses instead of mbox and then just copy it once in 
  G_analize_group instead of O(Gsize) Sess_get_session_index() calls.

* Make various binary packages available (rpm, deb, pkg, ...)

* Figure out hanging bug with max ARU window reported by Tom Mornini & co.
* Decide what to do with multipath patch from Marc Zyngier

* Add Yair's fix for delayed tokens. (*break)
