.SH DESCRIPTION
.B SP_get_vs_set_members
and its scatter variant extract the list of members of a particular VS set. 
The members are stored into an array of strings, each of which is MAX_GROUP_NAME characters in length.  
The number of strings (names) in the array should be provided in the
.I member_names_count
parameter. 

The 
.I memb_mess
field or scatter field  should be the body of a message that was returned in a previous 
.B SP_receive 
call for a membership message.

members in this VS set. No data is parsed. Reallocate
a larger array of member names (the required number is available
in the corresponding vs_set_info struct) and call this function again.
.SH BUGS
None.
