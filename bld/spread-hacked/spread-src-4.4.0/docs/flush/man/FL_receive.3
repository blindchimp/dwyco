.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FL_receive
is the general purpose message receipt function for Flush Spread.
Messages for all groups joined on this connection will arrive on the
same mailbox.  A call to
.B FL_receive
will perform a receive on a connection to get a single message from
any one of the groups to which it is joined.  

After a call to receive completes, a number of the passed fields are
set to values indicating meta-information about the message (such as
destination group, message type, endianness, etc).  The meanings of
these different meta fields depends on the type of message received
and the receipt services requested.

Input Parameters:
.RS
.TP 1.1i
.I mbox
Represents the connection on which to receive a message.
.TP 1.1i
.I serv_type
A pointer to a service bit field, requesting some receive services.
This field can have the DONT_BLOCK and/or DROP_RECV service bit flags
flipped on.  This bit field should be zeroed out before each call if
no special receive service is to be requested.
.TP 1.1i
.I sender
A pointer to a character array with storage for at least
MAX_GROUP_NAME characters.
.TP 1.1i
.I max_groups
A non-negative int representing how many group names the application
is willing to receive in this receive call.
.TP 1.1i
.I num_groups
A pointer to an int.
.TP 1.1i
.I groups
An array of group names containing storage for at least 
.I max_groups
* MAX_GROUP_NAME characters.
.TP 1.1i
.I mess_type
A pointer to an int16.
.TP 1.1i
.I endian_mismatch
A pointer to an int.
.TP 1.1i
.I max_mess_len
A non-negative integer representing how many bytes of data the
application is willing to receive in this call.
.TP 1.1i
.I mess
A pointer to a buffer containing storage for at least
.I max_mess_len
bytes.
.TP 1.1i
.I scat_mess
A pointer to a scatter (a cousin of an iovec) with a non-negative
number of scatter elements that is less than or equal to
MAX_SCATTER_ELEMENTS (that's not a typo :), and all non-negative
buffer lengths in the indicated scatter elements to get scatter-gather
semantics.
.RE

Receive Semantics:

Normally, a call to receive will block if no messages are immediately
available.

Normally, when calling a receive function if a user's buffer
.RI ( groups , 
.IR mess ,
or 
.IR scat_mess ) 
is too small to contain the data to be returned, then a
GROUPS_TOO_SHORT or BUFFER_TOO_SHORT error code will be returned.  In
this case, the
.IR serv_type ,
and 
.IR mess_type
of the message are filled in from the offending message and the
parameters
.IR num_groups ,
and 
.I endian_mismatch
reflect information about the necessary buffers' sizes.  If
.I max_groups
was big enough, then
.RI * num_groups
will be zero, otherwise it will be the negative of how many group
names are available to be received (i.e. -7 means the 
.I max_groups
was less than 7 and 7 group names can be received).  If
.I max_mess_len
or
.I scat_mess
was big enough then
.RI * endian_mismatch
will be zero, otherwise it will be the negative of how much data is
available to be received (i.e. -32768 means the msg buffer was too
small and 32768 bytes of data can be received).  The offending message
is still available to be received through later calls to receive with
appropriately sized user buffers.

The parameter
.I serv_type
allows the applications to request different receive services that
affect the normal semantics of receive.  Currently, the only services
are DONT_BLOCK and DROP_RECV.

The DONT_BLOCK service makes a receive call non-blocking.  With this
service, the receive call will return quickly either with a message or
with the error code WOULD_BLOCK if no message is available.  Using
this service is the only way to detect if a message is ready on the
connection in a non-blocking manner in Flush Spread.

The DROP_RECV service forces Flush Spread to read the current message
off of the connection regardless of whether or not the user's buffers
are big enough to fit all of the data.  In this case, a TOO_SHORT
error code is still returned even though the call actually
succeeded. Anyway, as much data as can be fit into the user's buffers
will be stuffed into them, and that message will no longer be on the
connection.  Also,
.RI * num_groups
will still be set to the negative size of how many names were
available (if 
.I groups
wasn't big enough), but
.RI * endian_mismatch
will not reflect the size of the data that could have been received (if
.I mess
or
.I scat_mess
wasn't big enough), instead it indicates whether or not the sending
machine had an opposite endianness or not.  Using DROP_RECV in this
manner, when a buffer problem occurs there is no way to determine how
big the data portion of the message actually was.  This service is
meant to be used when a call to receive without DROP_RECV fails with a
buffer error, but it is determined that the message isn't all that
important, or something along those lines; otherwise reallocate your
receive buffers appropriately and re-call receive again without
the DROP_RECV service.

Output Parameters:

Upon a successful return from receive, 
.RI * serv_type 
will be filled out with the message type that was just received.  The
specific type of message received can be tested using the different
message and membership type access macros.  The rest of the
parameters' meanings differ depending on the
.IR serv_type . 

Regular Messages:

If the
.I serv_type
is a REG_MESSAGE (i.e. a data message) then:

The parameter
.I sender
will be filled with the private group name of the sending connection.

The parameter
.I num_groups
will be set to the number of group names filled into
.IR groups .

The 
.I groups
array will contain the group to which this message was sent.  If the
message is a SUBGROUP_CAST (check the service type, see FL_multicast)
then all of the recipients' private group names will be listed and the
last name in the array (i.e.
.RI groups[* num_groups -1]) 
will be the regular group to which this message was sent.

If DROP_RECV is being used, and 
.I groups
is too small, then as many names as can fit will be filled in as above
described.  If the message was a SUBGROUP_CAST, then the last group in
the array (i.e.
.RI groups[ max_groups -1])
will be the destination group for the message. If 
.I max_groups
is zero then even the destination group is not reported.

The parameter
.RI * mess_type
will be set to the message type field the application sent with
the original message, which is a restricted (see FL_multicast) 16 bit
integer.  This value is endian corrected upon returning.

The parameter
.RI * endian_mismatch
will be set to true (non-zero) if the endianness of the sending
machine is the opposite of this receiving machine's.

The actual message body being received will be filled into either the
.I mess
or
.IR scat_mess 
parameter.

Flush Request Message:

If this is a FLUSH_REQ_MESS then this represents that the underlying
membership has changed and that this application needs to flush this
group before the new view/membership can be installed (see
FL_flush). 

The
.I sender
will be filled in with the name of the group this connection needs
to flush.  All the other fields are set to empty values.

Membership Messages:

If this is a MEMB_MESSAGE (i.e. membership message) and it
specifically is a REG_MEMB_MESS, then:

The 
.I sender
will be filled with the name of the group for which the membership
change is occuring.

The
.I mess_type
field will be set to the index of this process in the 
.I groups
array (see below). 

The
.I endian_mismatch
field will be set to 0 since there are no endian issues with regular memberships.

The
.I groups
array and message
body are used to provide two kinds of membership information about the change that just
occured in this group.  The 
.I num_groups
field will be set to the number of members in the group in the 
.B new
membership (i.e. after the change occured). Correspondingly, the 
.I groups
array will be filled in with the private group names of all members of this
group in the
.B new
membership.  This list of names is always in the same order at all receipients
and thus can be used to deterministically pick a group representative if
one is needed by the application.

The second set of information is stored in the message body.  The data
buffer will include the following fields:
.RS
.TP
.B group_id vid;
.br
.TP
.B int num_members;
.br
.TP
.B char dgroups[][MAX_GROUP_NAME];
.RE

The vid and num_members parameters will already be endian corrected.
The dgroups array will contain num_members group names.  The functions
FL_get_gid_offset_memb_mess(), FL_get_num_vs_offset_memb_mess() and
FL_get_vs_set_offset_memb_mess() provide the offsets to the associated
fields within the body of a membership message. The content of the
dgroups array is dependent upon the type of the membership change:
.RS
.TP 0.8i
.B CAUSED_BY_JOIN:
dgroups contains the private group of the joining process.
.TP
.B CAUSED_BY_LEAVE:
dgroups contains the private group of the leaving process.
.TP
.B CAUSED_BY_DISCONNECT:
dgroups contains the private group of the disconnecting process.
.TP
.B CAUSED_BY_NETWORK:
dgroups contains the group names of the members of the new membership who came 
with 
.B this
application to the new view/membership.  Using this data the previous
membership listing and the new membership listing an application can
determine all the members that left and were added in the NETWORK
membership change.  Note, that a member can both leave and be added in
a 
.B single
NETWORK change.
.RE

Transitional Message:

If this is a MEMB_MESSAGE and specifically it is a TRANSITION_MESS,
then this means that one or more of the current members of the group
has left and not all of the safety guarantees can be met w.r.t. all of
the original members for the messages delivered after this signal and
before the next view/membership.  Transitional messages never have a
CAUSED_BY type because they only serve to signal up to where SAFE
delivery and AGREED delivery (with no holes) is guaranteed in the
view/membership in which they are delivered.  Only one TRANSITION_MESS
is delivered per group view/membership per connection.

The 
.I sender
will be filled in with the name of the group for which the membership
change is occurring.  All the other parameters will be set to empty values.

Self-Leave Message:

If this is a MEMB_MESSAGE (i.e. membership message) and it is neither
a REG_MEMB_MESS or a TRANSITION_MESS, then it represents exactly the
situtation where the member receiving this message has left a group
and this is notification that the leave has occured, thus it is
sometimes called a self-leave message.  The simplest test for this is
if a message is CAUSED_BY_LEAVE and REG_MEMB_MESS is false (zero),
then it is a self-leave message.

The other members of the group that this member just left will receive
a normal TRANSITION_MESS, REG_MEMB_MESS pair as described above
showing this connection leaving.

For self-leave messages the
.I sender
field will be filled in with the name of the group this connection is
leaving.  All the other fields are set to empty values.

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns the size of the data portion of the message received on
success or one of the following errors ( < 0 ):
.TP 0.8i
.B ILLEGAL_SESSION
The connection represented by 
.I mbox
was illegal, usually because it is not active.
.TP
.B ILLEGAL_PARAM
An illegal parameter was passed, like a negative array size.
.TP
.B ILLEGAL_MESSAGE
The msg buffer had an illegal structure, like an illegal number of
scatter elements or a negatively sized buffer.
.TP
.B WOULD_BLOCK
The receive call was made with the DONT_BLOCK service and it would
have blocked because no messages were ready to be received.
.TP
.B GROUPS_TOO_SHORT
The receive call was made with a groups array that was too small.  
.RI * num_groups
is filled in with the negative number of names that could have been
returned.  Note, that the msg buffer could also be too short, and this
should be determined by examining
.I endian_mismatch
as described above. If DROP_RECV was used this error code actually
represents success (see above).
.TP
.B BUFFER_TOO_SHORT
The receive call was made with a msg buffer that was too small.
.RI * endian_mismatch
is filled in with the negative number of bytes that could have been
received if DROP_RECV isn't used.  If it is used then this error code
actually represents success and 
.I endian_mismatch
has the normal meaning (see above).  Note, that the groups buffer
could also be too short, this should be determined by examining
.I num_groups
as described above.
.TP
.B CONNECTION_CLOSED
During communication to receive, communication errors occurred
and the receive could not be completed.
