.TH FL_more_msgs 3 "Dec 2000" "Flush Spread" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
FL_more_msgs \- returns the number of complete messages buffered and
ready to be received on a connection.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <fl.h>

.BI "int FL_more_msgs(mailbox " mbox ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FL_more_msgs
allows an application to check to see if any complete messages are
already buffered and ready to be received on the connection represented by
.IR mbox .

.BR NOTE , 
that this function 
.B CANNOT 
be used as an I/O polling function to check if a receive call should
be done.  If this function returns zero there still might be a message
ready to receive on the connection: FL_poll, and file descriptor
selects/polls can detect if there is activity (not necessarily a
message) on a connection, while DONT_BLOCK receive semantics can
detect whether or not there is a message on the connection and
FL_more_msgs can only answer if there are any buffered messages
already on the connection.

This function is merely a helper function to re-get the current status
of the
.I more_messes
parameter returned from a call to 
.BR FL_receive .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns the number of complete buffered messages ready to be received,
or one of the following errors ( < 0):
.TP
.B ILLEGAL_SESSION
The connection represented by 
.I mbox
is illegal, usually because it is not active.
