.TH FL_flush 3 "Dec 2000" "Flush Spread" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
FL_flush \- flush a group in response to receiving a flush request message.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <fl.h>

.BI "int FL_flush(mailbox " mbox ", const char *" group_name ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FL_flush
flushes the group named
.I group_name
in which the connection represented by
.I mbox
has received a flush request message.  A flush request message is
delivered in a group when the underlying membership of that group
changes; it is a signal to the application that the membership has
changed and some of the original members may have "gone away" (meaning
that they are no longer in the group with this connection).  However,
Flush Spread will not install a new membership in the group until each
of the members of the new membership flush the group.  Flushing a
group gives Flush Spread the permission of this connection to go ahead
and install a new view/membership for the group.

During the time after receiving a flush request message but before
flushing the group the application must be _VERY_ careful about
calling receive functions; if the application isn't careful enough it
can permantently block the entire group.  For example, say the
underlying membership of a group of 10 members changed such that this
connection is now alone in the group (there is no way an application
can detect the make-up of a group after receiving a flush request).
If the application simply calls receive before flushing the group and
hasn't ensured that it will receive a message somehow (see below) it
will permanently block itself in the receive and any other members
that might later be added to that group.

There are a couple ways to avoid this problem, which isn't a bug by
the way :P, (1) don't call receive functions after receiving a flush
request message and before flushing the group, (2) call receive but
set the DONT_BLOCK service flag; if there aren't any messages to
receive it will break out with a WOULD_BLOCK error, (3) ensure that
there will be a message to receive somehow.  There are several ways to
do this, but one 100% sure way to do this is if the application sends
or has sent a message on this connection (with the SELF_DISCARD
service _NOT_ set) that it has not yet received back.  In this case,
the application will eventually receive its own message (even if it
was to another group) on the connection and can therefore be assured
of not blocking permanently.

The application _IS_ allowed to send messages to a group after
receiving a flush request for that group and before flushing the
group.  However, only a subset of the original members of the current
view will receive these messages (note that I said a subset, not a
strict subset).  Technically, this is always the case in Spread: an
application can determine which other members received certain
messages for sure by (1) application level message receipt
acknowledgement, (2) employing the safety properties of SAFE messages
(although this doesn't guarantee that those members actually processed
and handled the message), (3) employing the virtual synchrony property
and the transitional set of the new membership when it is installed
(although, again, this doesn't guarantee that those members actually
processed and handled the messages). See FL_receive or read up on
group communication for more in-depth discussions of this matter.

Anyways, when the application is ready it can flush the group.  Once
it flushes the group it is not allowed to send any messages to that
group, until it receives the new membership for that group.  If the
application breaks this rule, it will receive an ILLEGAL_STATE error.

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns 0 on success or one of the following errors ( < 0 ):
.TP
.B ILLEGAL_SESSION
The connection represented by 
.I mbox
is illegal. Usually because it is not active.
.TP
.B ILLEGAL_GROUP
The 
.I group_name
given to flush was illegal for some reason, usually because it was of
length 0 or length > MAX_GROUP_NAME.  This error can also be returned
when a group is flushed for a connection that it has not yet joined or
is already leaving.
.TP
.B ILLEGAL_STATE
A connection may flush a group only once in response to each flush
request message delivered in that group.  If you violate this rule you
will get an ILLEGAL_STATE error.
.TP
.B CONNECTION_CLOSED
Errors occurred during communication and the flush could not be
initiated.
