v1.1.0, May 2009

Changed the build so that the functions in stdthread.h are always defined, but most will simply 
return error codes when not built in a reentrant manner.  Added a "null mutex" that does nothing 
to allow user programs to always successfully call at least the mutex functions even in a 
non-reentrant build.

v1.0.1, November 2007

Fixed a few minor bugs.

v1.0.0, November 2006
