build the bot with qt5.6 requires some goofy stuff in order to
deploy it properly. the sqlite plugin and some auxilliary "icu" plugins
aren't normally available on every version of linux. so you need to have

libicudata.so.56
libicui18n.so.56
libicuuc.so.56
libqsqlite.so
libQt5Core.so.5
libQt5Sql.so.5

and a qt.conf file like this might be needed, though i'm not sure.
i couldn't get it to work, as i recall and just put everything in the
same directory and it seemed to workout.

[Paths]
Plugins = /home/dwight/Downloads/bots/clbot/plugins

then put this in plugins
plugins/sqldrivers/libqsqlite.so
