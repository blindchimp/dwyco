Notes on qt6 port of CDC-X

status:

* MAC: seems to work ok as a qt6 app, though video and audio needs a bit more testing.
* Windows: seems to work ok, but the deployment probably needs to change (install package in a more standard way, and point the data to the old qt5 folder.) Video/audio drivers need more testing.
* Linux: still need to use the v4l2 drivers for video, but otherwise seems to work. deployment is broken, since linuxdeployqt cannot build qt6 AppImages.

overall, changes to the code were minor qt6 naming and API changes.
