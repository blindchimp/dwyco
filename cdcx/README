This is the source code for CDC-X client UI.
It can be run on Windows 7+, Mac 10.12+, and Linux 18.04+.

As distributed by Dwyco, building requires:

Windows: MSVC 2017, 32bit, Qt 5.12

Mac: Xcode11, Qt 5.12

Linux: Ubuntu 18.04+, using the distro installed Qt 5.9

The windows build also depends on a 3rd party video capture library that
is closed-source (mitov.com). The mtcapxe.dll file is redistributable
(since Dwyco has paid for the license from mitov.com), but you will not
be able to rebuild mtcapxe.dll from source without buying a license from
mitov.com. If you are bold, you could write your own driver (see dlli.h
for how to do it) and not use mtcapxe.dll at all.
The DLL is 32bit, which is why you need to use 32bit MSVC. This is ok since
there aren't many advantages to moving to 64bit for this app.

Note: to get rid of mtcapxe, you would need to port the vgqt drivers to
windows properly like I did for MacOS. I gave it a quick try, but ran into
the usual vidcap problems, so I just gave up and used the old drivers, which
still work ok on Windows 10.
