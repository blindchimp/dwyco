This is the source code for CDC-X client UI.
It can be run on Windows XP+, Mac, and Linux.

As distributed by Dwyco, building requires:

Windows: MSVC 2008, Qt 4.8.7

Mac: Xcode9, Qt 4.8.7 (but NOT from Homebrew. It appears to build ok,
but produces binaries that popup weird boxes asking to download fonts.
Building Qt from scratch seems to solve the problem.)

Linux: Ubuntu 14.04+

UPDATE: Windows version 2.17 is released using simpler static build
for everything except the video capture driver (see below.) It
appears to be working ok in the field. The build still requires
VS2008, running on a magical laptop with Qt4 installed, but it is much
simpler than before.


The windows build prior to 2.17 
is *challenging* because the tools are antiques. I've
ported it up to Windows 10/Qt4 with more recent tools, but have not
distributed the build because I'm too much of a wuss to deal with the tech
support issues that might arise from a drastic change in build tactics.

I've also ported it up to Qt5, but there were some weird regressions with
the Mac toolbar and Linux desktop integration, so I never went any further
with it.

The windows build also depends on a 3rd party video capture library that
is closed-source (mitov.com). The mtcapxe.dll file is redistributable
(since Dwyco has paid for the license from mitov.com), but you will not
be able to rebuild mtcapxe.dll from source without buying a license from
mitov.com. If you are bold, you could write your own driver (see dlli.h
for how to do it) and not use mtcapxe.dll at all.
