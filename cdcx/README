This is the source code for CDC-X client UI.
It uses Qt4.8.
For version 2.15/2.16 (released late 2017)
it can be run on Windows XP+, Mac, and Linux.

As distributed by Dwyco, building requires:
Windows: MSVC 2008, Borland rad studio XE, Qt 4.8.7, DMake
Mac: Xcode9, Qt 4.8.7, QtCreator 4.5
Linux: Ubuntu 14.04+, QtCreator 4.5

The windows build is *challenging* because the tools are antiques. I've
ported it up to Windows 10/Qt4 with more recent tools, but have not
distributed the build because I'm too much of a wuss to deal with the tech
support issues that might arise from a drastic change in build tactics.

I've also ported it up to Qt5, but there were some weird regressions with
the Mac toolbar and Linux desktop integration, so I never went any further
with it.

The windows build also depends on a 3rd party video capture library that
is closed-source (mitov.com). The mtcapxe.dll file is redistributable
(since Dwyco has paid for the license from mitov.com), but you will not
be able to rebuild mtcapxe.dll from source without buying a license from
mitov.com. If you are bold, you could write your own driver (see dlli.h
for how to do it) and not use mtcapxe.dll at all.
