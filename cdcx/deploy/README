"Installer" download can be found at http://www.dwyco.com
Source code is on github.com, search for "dwyco".

The "installer" is a self-extracting shell script that creates a directory
called "cdcx" in $(HOME). It does not
install anything to your system directories, and it does not require
root privs (in fact, you should make sure you are NOT root before
installing it.)

The best way to install it is:
* download the installer to your home directory
* open a terminal window (which should default to your home directory.)
* type (depending on what you downloaded):

sh cdcx-linux-x86_64.sh

It should print out a few lines as it extracts the files. If it
complains about timestamps being in the future, you can ignore those warnings.

* next, to run cdcx type:
cd cdcx
./cdcx &

This version of CDC-X was compiled and tested using Qt 5.12 on Ubuntu 20.04.
If your system-native Qt package is installed, it should start and run.

Just a quick note: CDCX MUST BE STARTED WITH A WORKING DIRECTORY SET TO
THE CDCX INSTALLATION DIRECTORY. It will crash horribly otherwise. If
you open a terminal like above, you'll have no problems.

Dependencies
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils

on 16.04, and other newer distros, you may need these:
sudo apt-get install libsdl-sound1.2

if your distro doesn't have qt installed, you can try this:

sudo apt install qt5-default
sudo apt install libqt5gui5 libqt5multimedia5 libqt5webenginewidgets5
