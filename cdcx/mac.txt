There is nothing special about the mac build process once
you get XCode set up properly.

Distribution is harder though, and I've never submitted this
to the mac app store.

Apple codesigning is comically complicated to get set up.

You'll need XCode, and developer account at apple.com to do it, but
anything I put here will be out of date as of the next version of the
website or devtools apple releases.
