around the time i updated the website to use wix.com, with a
gallery that flipped images endlessly, i saw cdc-x growing in size
like something was leaking. well, turns out that i had the "don't
load directories", which defaults to the www.dwyco.com. the
qtwebkit lib leaks like a sieve while it is showing those images.
most people leave the defaults, so they won't see the problem.

also, it appears QtWebkit get random seg faults on Linux with
the lib provided by the distro. Caveat emptor
