The "fix" for the crt-init error a lot of people were having
was to delay load the video capture dll (mtcapxe.dll). 
i haven't figured out why, but this fixes it as i get no more
tech support emails regarding this problem after doing it this way.
possibly it has something to do with the static/dynamic linking of
the crt into multiple dll's in the app as a whole.
