* use uid's to allow sane connect/disconnect so a cam can broadcast.
* on desktop, redo layout so video can be bigger
* maybe add zoom on the video
* reload all profiles in pal list on start so we get latest names
* see if we can acquire wakelock so the phone doesn't sleep while we are on.
* remove phone poweroff at 10pm
* figure out why camera isn't blitting to screen
* maybe use videooutput in cam mode when not connected to anyone
* put an option to use back cam, so you can point it out a window
* put fdroid repo on www.dwyco.com
