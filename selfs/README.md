Selfs is a simple app to capture video from a camera and stream it to clients.

It is intended mainly so I can use some old phones that are no longer useful for general debugging.

It requires Qt 5.12 on Android. The Desktop version is used as the "viewer". You can also use the Android version as a viewer.

There is nothing user-friendly or flexible about this app right now.
