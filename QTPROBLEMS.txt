the android versions of the apps here have been successfully using
Qt 5.15.9. I tried moving up to Qt 5.15.12, but there are some changes
to how come components render (Toolbars and ToolButtons, for rando, for example.) that are not worth trying to debug.

Also, the 5.15.12 androiddeployqt doesn't appear to be able to create a proper release for phoo, complaining about a missing FileDialog that is not deployed properly to the apk. Again, also not worth debugging it. This is mentioned in QTBUG-110360,
