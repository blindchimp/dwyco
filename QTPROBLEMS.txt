the android versions of the apps here have been successfully using
Qt 5.15.9. I tried moving up to Qt 5.15.12, but there are some changes
to how come components render (Toolbars and ToolButtons, for rando, for example.) that are not worth trying to debug.

Also, the 5.15.12 androiddeployqt doesn't appear to be able to create a proper release for phoo, complaining about a missing FileDialog that is not deployed properly to the apk. Again, also not worth debugging it. This is mentioned in QTBUG-110360,

for qt5 and linux, using linuxdeployqt works mostly as long as you use ubuntu 18.04 to compile.

for qt6 and linux, there is no working similar tool. trying to build and just let the platform installed qt6 attempt to run is a waste of time. the number of dependencies is too huge.

attempting to do a static build with qt6.5 almost worked, but QtMultimedia using the required ffmpeg would not build (and doesn't work, even though phoo starts, it just can't load any of the multimedia components. i guess the fallback to the native drivers doesn't even work.)

cdcx on linux using static qt6 will not work because static qwebengine is not supported. it probably is a waste of time to port it up to qt6 anyways.

so, in summary, qt6 on linux is a waste of time.

qt6 on macos and windows (which both have supported "deploy" tools) is plausible for both cdcx and phoo.

qt6 port branches:
qt-6.8-port - doesn't work for a myriad of reasons (deployment problems, bugs in 6.8 release, etc.)
qt-6.5-port - this actually turned into a qt 6.7 release. qt6.7 is terrible, do not use.
qt-6.5-backport - this is qt-6.5-port with the qt6.7 specific things removed (mostly permissions i think, which were only half-assed into qt 6.7)

deployment status:
rando (android only): deployed with qt 6.8.0 (since rando has no input text boxes, it avoided glaring qt bug)
phoo (android, still deployed with qt 5.15.9, blocked because of text box and deployment bugs in qt6)
cdcx
	* windows - still on qt5.15, 32bit, using old capture drivers.
	* macos  - attempted 6.8, but audio,video, and permissions bugs caused us to back-out to 6.5.3. 6.5.3 release is ok, but i received multiple reports from users of crashes. i them to downgrade to previous version, and that solved their problems.
	* linux - qt5 appimages still kinda work. as noted above, qt6 is a waste of time.
