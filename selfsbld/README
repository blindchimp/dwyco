Selfs is a Qt5 simple camera watcher/capture app

Current requirements:
* Qt 5.12
* For Linux: Ubuntu 20.04+

To build on Linux:

* Get Qt5 set up (make sure the default qmake gets the right version.)
* Clone repo into the right place (the build scripts are a bit dumb about this
right now, so do it this way):

cd $(HOME)
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/blindchimp/dwyco

cd dwyco
sh selfsbld/deps.sh (installs a few dev packages that are needed.)

-----------

* SHADOW BUILD selfs:

cd $(HOME)/git/dwyco
selfsbld/build.sh

(note: there are some qmake peculiarities that seem to require the
invocation to be done exactly as shown above.)

The result should be in $(HOME)/git/build-selfs/selfs/selfs
-----------

If you run "selfs", it will create its data directory in
$(HOME)/Documents/dwyco/selfs. There should be no need for 
any other installation, as it "installs" everything it needs
if it doesn't already exist. On desktop, if there is an argument
it uses that directory. On mobile, it uses internal app storage
which is erased when the app is uninstalled.
