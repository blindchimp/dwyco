Phoo is an experimental Qt5 encrypted messenger.

Current requirements:
* Qt 5.9.x or 5.10.1
* For Linux: Ubuntu Trusty or later

Mac/Windows/Android/iOS
TBD

To build on Linux Trusty:

* Get Qt5 set up (make sure the default qmake gets the right version.)
* Clone repo into the right place (the build scripts are a bit dumb about this
right now, so do it this way):

cd $(HOME)
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/blindchimp/dwyco

cd dwyco
sh phoobld/deps.sh (installs a few dev packages that are needed.)

-----------

* IN-TREE BUILD phoo and create AppDir in $(HOME)/git/dwyco/phoo/appdir:
cd $(HOME)/git/dwyco
sh phoobld.sh

-----------

* SHADOW BUILD phoo:

cd $(HOME)/git/dwyco
phoobld/build.sh

(note: there are some qmake peculiarities that seem to require the
invocation to be done exactly as shown above.)

The result should be in $(HOME)/git/build-phoo/phoo/phoo
-----------

If you run "phoo", it will create its data directory in
$(HOME)/Documents/dwyco/phoo. There should be no need for 
any other installation, as it "installs" everything it needs
there if it doesn't already exist. There is also no way to make
it use another directory at the moment.
