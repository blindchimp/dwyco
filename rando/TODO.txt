* make it more obvious exactly what is new (your pic got sent, you received new pic, etc.)
* (done) see if we can get some mapping stuff to show geo data instead of text
* (done) update server to store coords in addition to text geolocations
* (done) make reviewer take fewer clicks (needs to "ok and hide" pic, for example)
* add minimal interaction (sort of a "like" thing) so people can get a tiny bit of positive feedback
* change from garish colors to something more muted for ios
* try multi-select stuff for favs and deletes
* add date display somewhere for a pic (create? received?)
* maybe add option for coarse location from the device rather than ip
* try a grid display mode for browsing
* test on tablets, some of the icons are too small to click
* don't allow you to do "abuse report" on your own pics
* add a "seeder" option for people that just want to generate content without receiving anything in return
* add indicator that you are expecting a rando
* add built-in notification that prompts people to take a picture once a week or something
* add cross-app promo to phoo and other dwyco stuff
* try putting the favorite right on the msg viewer instead of hiding it in a menu
* fix bug that causes a new rando notification and then nothing is there when you open the program
* see how we might be able to give users a "freebie" from time to time without rrequiring them to take a pic
