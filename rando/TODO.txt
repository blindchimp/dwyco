* make it more obvious exactly what is new (your pic got sent, you received new pic, etc.)
* see if we can get some mapping stuff to show geo data instead of text
* update server to store coords in addition to text geolocations
* make reviewer take fewer clicks (needs to "ok and hide" pic, for example)
* add minimal interaction (sort of a "like" thing) so people can get a tiny bit of positive feedback
* change from garish colors to something more muted for ios
* try multi-select stuff for favs and deletes
* add date display somewhere for a pic (create? received?)
* maybe add option for coarse location from the device rather than ip
* try a grid display mode for browsing
* test on tablets, some of the icons are too small to click
