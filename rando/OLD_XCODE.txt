NOTE: for qt5.6.0
it appears the version of xcode (5-ish) is too old, and doesn't quite
jive with the qt binaries that are provided with 5.6.0 (compiled with clang).
it is probably somsething to do with the stdc library, and it might be
possible to tweak the mac drivers in macdrv to avoid the linking problems,
by tweaking the deployment target and SDK,
but it is not worth the time. just use the later versions of macos and xcode.
